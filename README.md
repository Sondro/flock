## Download

Sorry, no time to build the app and upload to GitHub for now. I will set up Automatic GitHub release soon.

However you can always build from source, and it works on macOS/Windows/Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egoist/flock.git
cd flock
yarn
yarn dist
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egoist/flock.git
cd flock
yarn
yarn start
```
